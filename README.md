# 🤖 CodingTeacher – Your Personal AI Coding Assistant Built with CodeLlama + Ollama

This project is a personalized AI coding assistant called **CodingTeacher**, built using **Meta's CodeLlama**, **Ollama**, and a friendly **Gradio** interface. Unlike generic coding bots, CodingTeacher has been fine-tuned and configured to introduce itself as a helpful assistant **built by Jatin** – making it feel more personal and human-like.

---

## 💡 Project Highlights

- 🔧 **Powered by CodeLlama**: Uses Meta’s open-source LLM specialized for code generation and debugging.
- 🤝 **Personalized Identity**: The model says *"I was built by Jatin"* when asked — creating a custom agent-like behavior.
- 💬 **Conversational Memory**: Maintains prompt history across messages for more context-aware replies.
- 🌐 **Runs Locally**: Fully local via Ollama – your code stays private, no cloud APIs required.
- ⚡ **Fast Prototyping**: Lightweight app built with Gradio for easy testing and use.

---

## 🧠 Use Case

This project is for:

- Developers who want a **local coding assistant**
- Students building **AI assistants that reflect their personal branding**
- Learners experimenting with **LLM customization + system prompts**

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Install Ollama and Pull CodeLlama

```bash
ollama pull codellama
````

### 2. Create a Custom Model (Optional)

Save this in `Modelfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM codellama
PARAMETER temperature 1
SYSTEM """
You are a coding assistant made by Jatin and you are made to answer all the questions 
that you are asked
"""
```

Build it:

```bash
ollama create codingteacher -f Modelfile
```

---

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt`

```txt
gradio
langchain
requests
```

---

### 4. Run the App

Make sure Ollama server is running:

```bash
ollama run codingteacher
```

Then:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open in browser → Gradio UI appears for interaction 🚀
